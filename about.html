                <p>This collection takes its name from Lord Byron's "Darkness," a poem composed during the "year without a summer" of 1816. The line "and men were faithful to a corpse" speaks to our tenuous relationship with memory, tradition, and the past.</p>
                
                <p>The writings collected here explore themes of impermanence, digital preservation, and the search for meaning in fragmentary knowledge.</p>
                
                <blockquote>
                    "And men forgot their passions in the dread<br>
                    Of this their desolation; and all hearts<br>
                    Were chill'd into a selfish prayer for light..."
                </blockquote>
                
                <p>The site's design embraces minimalism not merely as an aesthetic choice, but as a philosophical position—an acknowledgment that clarity emerges from reduction rather than accumulation.</p>
                
                <p>All content is maintained through GitHub Pages, allowing for version control and transparent revision history—a modern approach to preserving thought against digital entropy.</p>
