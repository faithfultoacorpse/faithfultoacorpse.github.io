        <p>They are born, live, and die in the depths of cave rivers; sunlight hasn't touched their bloodline in generations. There isn't much life in these caverns, as a result these creatures have incredible control over their metabolism and can enter hibernatory states at will, and can go years at a time without eating if needed. Another notable product of such an environment is the creature's vestigial eyes, embedded below sealed flesh in lizard-like skulls. Their evolutionary ancestors, at one point, saw the illumination of the sun and rejected the warmth - they sought depth. And their descendants sought to go deeper. And their descendants descendants no longer had a use for those eyes which only rendered black. Today, they go ever deeper.</p>
        <p>By all means, the existence of such an organism is highly improbable, a testament to the sheer willpower of biology. The existence of a specific one of these organisms, in a specific cavern, at a specific moment was even more improbable.</p>
        <p>Odd things sometimes happen in this world, phenomena which - like most improbabilities - go forever unrecorded by man. You may not know, but many such phenomena occur deep below the earth's surface, nigh impossible to see or measure. These events may be physically explainable: geological phenomena which only occur in the extremest conditions of the crust, chance chemical reactions, the byproduct of some undiscovered particle; they may be unexplainable: the whims of gods of mischief, or the side-effect of a curled finger on a monkey's paw. It doesn't matter, we won't know. One of the earlier mentioned creatures was the victim of such an event.</p>
        <p>It was quite a normal day - if you could call it that - for our creature: another immeasurable stint near hibernation in an ordinary, cool, and gentle stream. It had not eaten in months which was, again, not abnormal. Though its metabolism was almost entirely suspended, the specimen was fully aware of the iciness of the stream rippling around it. It was aware as the stream began to lose its chill, as the water turned from cold, to cool, to lukewarm. During this warming, the stream began to reduce in pressure and slow to a trickle.</p>
        <p>Our creature would not react to such an unusual change by scurrying away as one might expect, it could not even if it wanted to (one cannot instantly resume a paused metabolism). And so, it sat as the once-cool stream began to evaporate entirely. And the specimen was not scared as the cool air in the cavern began to heat, even though it was the first time it - and perhaps any of its recent ancestors - experienced warmth.</p>
        <p>Unbeknownst to the specimen, an incredible beam of light had begun to emit from a wall of the cavern. This beam chanced to form a spotlight around our creature. The ray grew in intensity - slow at first, and then all at once. At its end, it was so bright that the water rolling into its aperture would evaporate instantly; it was so luminous that an outside observer (with functional eyes, mind you) might think that the beam would melt through any stone in its path, that it would surely render any organic material in its path into a scattered pile of carbon.</p>
        <p>Even though all of its recent ancestors retreated from light far gentler than this, even though this creature was the final product of the forces that drove its species underground, its emotional reactivity was suppressed entirely. Yes, it was incapable of moving even if it wanted to, but it didnt. Internally, it was undergoing something entirely unusual: there was not a trace of panic. You see, near the end of the beam's intensification there was a window in which the light was, for a split second, gentle enough to simply warm the creature and simultaneously bright enough to penetrate the flesh hiding the vestigial eyes. The eyes were not unchanged below the surface, they had deformed and were certainly useless for survival even if somehow opened. There were, however, deformed photoreceptors still capable of exciting <em>something</em> in the remaining optical nerves.</p>
        <p>During this fraction of a moment, the light excited those pitiful photoreceptors, and our creature was imparted with intangible memories of an existence before its species' journey to the bottom. It was imparted with recollections of the surface, of the elements, of noises other than water trickling on stone. It was imparted with a stronger recollection of another luminary, gentle and all encompassing; it was left with an image of the same eyelid-defracted red form that one sees when resting their eyes on a hot summer day. Until now the creature was composed, but in this fraction of a moment it was filled with what we might call anguish at the circumstances of its life, terror at the thought of change, and finally gratitude at a reminder of warmth.</p>
        <p>As mentioned earlier, this creature was a victim of this unusual phenomenon. After the split second in which once-dormant optical nerves had been excited and genetic memories had awakened, the light resumed its growth in intensity. The specimen was reduced almost immediately into a pile of char.</p>
        <p>The water, which was until now held at bay by the ray's heat, resumed to trickle down the cavern.</p>
        <p>A ghost of the spotlight remained as the stone of the cavern floor glowed red.</p>
        <p>The water boiled as it rolled over our specimen's ashes.</p>
        <p>The steam began to creep upwards towards the cavern entrance.</p>
