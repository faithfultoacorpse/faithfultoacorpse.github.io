            I live, I stay alive, so that Borges can make his literature, and this literature is my justification.<br>
            I readily admit that a few of his pages are worthwhile, but these pages are not my salvation, perhaps because good writing belongs to no one in particular, not even to my other, but rather to language and tradition. <br>
            As for the rest, I am fated to disappear completely, and only a small piece of me can possibly live in the other one.<br>
            ...<br>
            Thus my life is an escape. I will lose everything, and everything will belong to oblivion, or to the other.<br>
            I don’t know which of us wrote this.<br>

            Just quit reading this and do something for me: take a look at your life. What are you proud of? What actions do you identify with? Perhaps your degree, your job, the books you read or the art you make?
            When you're meeting new people, and you're nervous about making a good impression, what do you wish you could naturally bring into the conversation to impress them?
            Those things, is it really you doing all of them? Of course you did, someone did, and they had your body, so who else could it have been? 
        </p>
        <p>
            I've got experiences like that too, I've got accomplishments. I haven't changed the world per say, but my family says I've made them proud.
            By no means am I some form of inhuman prodigy, nor was I groomed for success by engineer parents (Not that there's anything wrong if you <em>are</em> an inhuman prodigy or if you <em>were</em> groomed for
            success by engineer parents). Allegedly, I am "living the dream." Or whatever. But it doesn't really feel like <em>my</em> dream, and it doesn't really feel like <em>I</em> did it. Looking back at the events that brought
            me to my goals is like watching a Bulgarian art-house film: it makes no sense. Without being hyperbolic, 
            an entity possessed me when I was 14. No, really, that's what it felt like in the moment, that's what it looks like
            in hindsight, and if true, someone else might be living your life right now.
        </p>
        <h2>The Possession</h2>
        <p>
            None of my family had been to college, I didn't have many close connections who had gone, 
            and yet with zero guidance for what to do to succeed, my body was compelled to do various
            things that would increase my odds. Not in any sort of methodical, rational sense, I didn't do research on how to get into college or anything silly like that; one day I woke up
            and began practicing standardized tests, and enrolled in as many AP classes as possible, and entered student government, and became the captain of the tennis team, and started volunteering, and got mentors, and so on and so forth. And I didn't do any of that.
            I'm not sure it was physically possible for me to do any of that: at the time I had terrible insomnia and typically slept 5 hours <em>per week</em>.
            To wit, in my sleepless dream, someone overtook me, someone who could do all of that. 
            It paid off quite well, materially, but the actions which transformed me into a wunderkind (relative to my younger, more 
            lackadaisical self) required sacrifices that the lackadaisical one would not have taken. 
        </p>
        <p>
            You see, deep down I'm a good old boy. I love my grandma, and I sneak fingers of cake batter when she's baking, and I stay up late to eat the snacks I'm not supposed to have, and I help my mom garden, and I ride my bike around
            the neighborhood with all the other good old boys. This was important to me, being there for family was fundamental to being the best version of me. 
            And I gave it all away... After getting a full ride, the drive persisted and consumed me throughout undergrad and grad school, there was no time for good-old-boy antics any more. 
            You cannot just postpone good-old-boy antics for half a decade and return expecting that world to be unchanged. But a good old boy - a real one - wouldnt do that.

            Perhaps you're not like me: you're decisive, have always been driven, knew what you wanted to do, executed a visible agency to do so, and so on. In that case,
            I do not think you'll understand the things I'm talking about. Apparently Wittgenstein said a similar thing (I will not pretend to have read the book yet, thank you  <a href="https://eggreport.substack.com/p/great-man-of-theory-theory">eggreport</a>)
        </p>

            This book will perhaps only be understood by those who have themselves already thought the thoughts which are expressed

            who read it with understanding and to whom it afforded pleasure.<br>
            - Wittgenstein, <em>Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</em> 
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Unlike one of the earlier referenced persons, I'm not decisive or the other things; I kind of like material success inasmuch as I can spend money, 
            but I don't really have much I'd like to spend it on anyways; I enjoy learning but I value humility more than knowledge, 
            and I wouldn't like to be the kind of person who needs to appear smart to the people around me; most of all, I'm rather lazy and weak willed! 
            I don't think it's possible to maintain that drive for ~a decade when one views the reward as less valuable than the required toll. Thus, The Possessor is my explanation.  
            Now I find myself asking: If The Possessor is unsatisfied or has since left, then what was the point? 
        </p>
        <p>
            Hold on, I'm getting ahead of myself. The correct first question is, am I just schizophrenic? 
        </p>
        
        <h2>I'm probably not crazy</h2>
        
        <p>
            It's odd, actually, I've stumbled upon a number of similar sentiments by chance in the past few weeks, and while writing this
            I've recollected a few more. You read the Borges quote in the beginning (By the way, read the whole poem for god's sake, it's like 5 lines). I heard Gwern reference the poem and share the sentiment in his <a href="https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/gwern-branwen">interview with Dwarkesh Patel</a>. 
            It's comforting knowing that certifiably, this phenomenon has not just happened to me. Borges doesn't beat around the bush, it is almost exactly the same feeling I have - a disctinct separation between self and other. It's not just Borges either, read this:
        </p>
        
        <blockquote>
                Every man has a twofold life: On one side is his personal life, which is free in proportion as its interests are abstract; the other is life as an element, as one bee in the swarm; and here a man has no chance 
            of disregarding the laws imposed on him. The higher a man stands on the social ladder, the more men he is connected with, the greater the influence he exerts over others—the more evident is the predestined
            and unavoidable necessity of his every action. <br>
                The king is the slave of history. In the events of history, so-called great men are merely tags that supply a name to the event, and have quite as little connection with the event itself as the tag. <br>
                Every one of their actions, though apparently performed by their own free will, is, in its historical significance, out of the scope of volition, and is correlated with the whole trend of history; and is, 
            consequently, preordained from all eternity.<br>
            - Leo Tolstoy, <em>War and Peace</em>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>
            Tolstoy too, seems to admit a duality to agency in life. While part of you may exist with agency, the other is swept almost by instinct, by the flow of history. 
            The primary difference between my ramblings and what Tolstoy says is that I do not think one needs to be a "great man of history" to fall victim to such forces.
            I've got more, look!
        </p>
        
        <blockquote>

            and if you have been chosen,<br>

            itself and it will keep on doing it<br>

        </blockquote>
        
        <p>
            Extrapolate Bukowski's words for a second: it's not just writing, <em>nothing</em> is worth doing unless you are "chosen". He literally says that a separate doer will overtake you until either you - the watcher - or the doer dies.
            Then, Bukowski marks three, quod erat demonstrandum! 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Q.E.D. may have been presumptuous, but if that's not enough, look at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn19/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin">every buddhist ever</a>.
            One of the common introductions of how to meditate involves separating the thinker and the watcher: one is supposed to embody the watcher by observing as thoughts come and go without judgement. I'll omit any quotes, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ram_Dass">Ram Dass</a> echoed exactly
            such a sentiment, and the act of embodying the watcher is what separated him from his doer's role at Harvard... that, and maybe <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1977/12/04/archives/confessions-of-an-american-guru-ram-dass.html">all of the acid</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            So Borges, Tolstoy, and Bukowski made three, every buddhist ever makes, like, three plus 400 million? I mean, surely that's quod erat demonstratum that this isn't totally out there.

        <h2>There are two jungle cats inside of you</h2>

        <p>Merab Abramishvili - <em>Black Panther</em> and <em>Leopard</em></p>
        
        <p>
            My point is, you're at least two jungle cats - I mean, people. One of whom controls your body when your existence is almost entirely a reaction external stimuli, but as the stimulus lost its novelty a second emerges and begins 
            manifesting internal desires into the external world. I will admit, I was being hyperbolic when I said I was possessed, surely we have the ability to balance control between these two cats - I mean, personas. 
            Any sacrifices in my life which were made by person two were, in all likelihood, implicitly agreed to by person one.
            Perhaps that's just how this life works, people get sucked into their jobs, hobbies, whatever <em>all the time</em>, and people get oneshot by passivity all the time as well. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It's a blessing to be possessed, to feel so compelled by something that you can pour yourself entirely into it. But it's a tragedy to sacrifice the rest that this life offers in pursuit of it. Like I said before, I'm 
            really not some sort of prodigal child, and neither was the other. It took an immense amount of effort and time to achieve those goals. At points, my own family seemed to me strangers,
            or perhaps vice-versa; family cannot be bought, conjured by reading, or derived from any set of equations, losing family 
            due to self-serving actions is a terrible loss. This whole post started as a warning to the currently possessed: be conscious of what you are and are not willing to sacrifice for your goals.
        </p>
        <p>
            The pendulum swings. It's why the other other me, the first one, the other cat, the-
            It's why one of us is writing this now. I have felt another loss, the possessor achieved their more immediate goals, and the one who was watching was startled awake from the vacuum that still lingered.
            This life is a fine balance between these two cats. It's basically democracy. Or maybe it's more like the 4-year presidential cycle in the US. Whatever! 
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm beginning to think that identifying the ridge, the narrow path so to speak, which pleases both cats is what leads one to a greater sense of fulfillment. At least, that's what I'm attempting to do now. 
        </p>
        <p>
            But, I don't really know. I'm just trying to figure out what has happened to me in the past 7 years and what I can learn for tomorrow.
            And I don’t know which of us wrote this.
