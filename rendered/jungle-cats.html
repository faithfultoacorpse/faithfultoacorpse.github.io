            I live, I stay alive, so that Borges can make his literature, and this literature is my justification.<br>
            I readily admit that a few of his pages are worthwhile, but these pages are not my salvation, perhaps because good writing belongs to no one in particular, not even to my other, but rather to language and tradition. <br>
            As for the rest, I am fated to disappear completely, and only a small piece of me can possibly live in the other one.<br>
            ...<br>
            Thus my life is an escape. I will lose everything, and everything will belong to oblivion, or to the other.<br>
            I don’t know which of us wrote this.<br>

            Just quit reading this and do something for me: take a look at your life. What are you proud of? What actions do you identify with? Perhaps your degree, your job, the books you read or the art you make?
            When you're meeting new people, and you're nervous about making a good impression, what do you wish you could naturally bring into the conversation to impress them?
            Those things, is it really you doing all of them? Of course you did, someone did, and they had your body, so who else could it have been? 
        </p>
        <p>
            I've got experiences like that too, I've got accomplishments. I haven't changed the world per say, but my family says I've made them proud.
            By no means am I some form of inhuman prodigy, nor was I groomed for success by engineer parents (Not that there's anything wrong with you <em>are</em> an inhuman prodigy or if you <em>were</em> groomed for
            success by engineer parents). Allegedly, I am "living the dream." Or whatever. But it doesn't really feel like *my* dream, and it doesn't really feel like *I* did it. Looking back at the events that brought
            me to my goals is like watching a Bulgarian art-house film: it makes no sense. Without being hyperbolic, 
            an entity possessed me when I was 14. No, really, that's what it felt like in the moment, that's what it looks like
            in hindsight, and that's what I'm trying to get you to see (whether this has happened to you or not)!
        </p>
        <h2>The Possession</h2>
        <p>
            None of my family had been to college, I didn't have many close connections who had been to college, 
            and yet with zero guidance for what to do to "become somebody," my body was compelled to do various
            things that would increase my odds of succeeding. Not in any sort of methodical, rational sense. I didn't do research on how to get into college or anything silly like that, one day I woke up
            and decided I would be the captain of the tennis team, and enrolled in as many AP classes as possible, and I entered student government, and I started volunteering, and I got mentors. And I didn't do any of that. 
            To wit, I was piloted by a (hopefully) divine force, completely against my control. 
            It paid off quite well, materially, but the actions which transformed me into a wunderkind - relative to my younger, more 
            mischevious self - were not the sorts of things that the same mischevious self would have done; the side-effects of that drive required sacrifices that the mischevious one would not have taken. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Deep down, I'm a good old boy. I love my grandma, and I sneak fingers of cake batter when she's baking, and I stay up late to eat the snacks I'm not supposed to have, and I help my mom garden, and I ride my bike around
            the neighborhood with all the other good old boys. And I gave it all away. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Perhaps, you're not like me: you're decisive, have always been driven, knew what you wanted to do, executed a visible agency to do so, and so on. In that case,
            I do not think you'll understand the things I'm talking about. Apparently Wittgenstein said a similar thing (I will not pretend to have read the book yet, thank you  <a href="https://eggreport.substack.com/p/great-man-of-theory-theory">eggreport</a>)
        </p>
        <blockquote>

            who read it with understanding and to whom it afforded pleasure.<br>

        <p>
            Unlike one of the earlier referenced persons, I'm not decisive or the other things; I kind of like money inasmuch as I can spend it,
            but I don't really have much I'd like to spend it on anyways; I enjoy learning but I value humility more than knowledge, 
            and I wouldn't like to be the kind of person who needs to appear smart to the people around me; most of all, I'm rather lazy and weak willed! All of this begs the 
            question: what was it all for? What did the other me intend to manifest through my possession? 
        </p>
        <p>
            Hold on, I'm getting ahead of myself. The correct first question is, am I just schizophrenic? 
        </p>
        
        <h2>I'm probably not crazy</h2>
        
        <p>
            It's odd, actually, I've stumbled upon a number of similar sentiments by chance in the past few weeks, and while writing this
            I've recollected a few more. You read the Borges quote in the beginning (By the way, read the whole poem for god's sake, it's like 5 lines). I heard it mentioned while listening to <a href="https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/gwern-branwen">Dwarkesh Patel's interview with Gwern Branwen</a> for the third
            or fourth time. It's comforting knowing that certifiably, this phenomenon has not just happened to me. Importantly, Borges doesn't beat around the bush, it is almost exactly the same feeling I have. But It's not just Borges either, read this:
        </p>
        
        <blockquote>
                Every man has a twofold life: On one side is his personal life, which is free in proportion as its interests are abstract; the other is life as an element, as one bee in the swarm; and here a man has no chance 
            of disregarding the laws impose on him. The higher a man stands on the social ladder, the more men he is connected with, the greater the influence he exerts over others--the more evident is the predestined
            and unavoidable necessity of his every action. 
                The king is the slave of history. In the events of history, so-called great men are merely tags that supply a name to the event, and have quite as little connection with the event itself as the tag. 
                Every one of their actions, though apparently performed by their own free will, is, in its historical significance, out of the scope of volition, and is correlated with the whole trend of history; and is, 
            consequently, preordained from all eternity.<br>
            - Leo Tolstoy, <em>War and Peace</em>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>
            The primary difference between my ramblings and Tolstoy's is that one need not be a "great man of history" to fall victim to such forces.
            I've got more, look!
        </p>
        
        <blockquote>

            and if you have been chosen,<br>
            it will do it by<br>
            itself and it will keep on doing it<br>

        </blockquote>
        
        <p>
            Extrapolate beyond Bukowski's reference to writing: *nothing* is worth doing unless you are "chosen". Moreso, a separate doer will overtake you until either you -- the watcher -- die, or the doer dies.
            Then, Bukowski marks three, quod erat demonstrandum! 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            If that's not enough, look at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn19/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin">every buddhist ever</a>.
            One of the common introductions of how to meditate involves separating the thinker and the watcher: one is supposed to embody the watcher by observing as thoughts come and go without judgement. I'll omit any quotes, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ram_Dass">Ram Dass</a> echoed exactly
            such a sentiment, and the act of embodying the watcher is what separated him from his doer's role in Cambridge... that, and maybe <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1977/12/04/archives/confessions-of-an-american-guru-ram-dass.html">all of the acid</a>.
    </p>
        <p>
            So Borges, Tolstoy, and Bukowski made three, every buddhist ever makes, like, three plus 400 million? I mean, surely that's quod erat demonstratum that this isn't totally out there.

        <h2>There are two jungle cats inside of you</h2>

        <img src="./images/jungle-cats/leopard.jpg" width="370" height="40">
        <p>Merab Abramishvili - Leopard and Black Panther</p>
        
        <p>
            My point is, you're at least two jungle cats -- I mean, people. One of you controlled your body when you were an amalgamation of motor reflexes and sensory data, but as the stimulus lost its novelty a second you emerged and begins acting upon the 
            world. This means I lied earlier, I was being hyperbolic when I said I was possessed, surely we have the ability to balance between these two cats -- I mean, people. Any sacrifices which were made by my other were implicitly agreed to by me.
            I think that's just how this life works, people get sucked into their jobs, their hobbies, their personas *all the time*; and yet, people get sucked oneshot by passivity all the time as well. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It's a blessing to be possessed, to feel so compelled by something that you can pour yourself entirely into it. But it's a tragedy to sacrifice the rest that this life offers in pursuit of it. As I mentioned before, I'm 
            really not some sort of prodigal child, and neither was my other. It took an immense amount of effort and time to achieve those goals. At points, my own family seemed to me strangers,
            or perhaps vice-versa; family cannot be bought, conjured by reading, or derived from any set of equations, losing family 
            due to self-serving actions is a terrible loss. This whole post started as a warning to the currently possessed: do not sacrifice bonds with whoever you choose to call family for your goals.
        </p>
        <p>
            The pendulum swings. It's why the other other me, the first one, the other cat, the--
            It's why that one is writing this now. I have felt another loss, the possessor achieved their more immediate goals, and the one who was watching was startled awake from the vacuum that still lingered.
            This life is a fine balance between these two cats. It's basically democracy. Or maybe it's more like the 4-year presidential cycle in the US. Whatever! 
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm not entirely sure, but I think that identifying the ridge, the narrow path so to speak, which pleases both cats is what leads one to a greater sense of fulfillment. That's what I'm attempting to do now. 
        </p>
        <p>
            But, I don't really know. I'm still young, naive, and just trying to figure out what has happened to me in the past 7 years.
            And I don’t know which of us wrote this.
